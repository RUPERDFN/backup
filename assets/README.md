# Assets (planned)

This folder will hold shared binary/static resources reused by landing, webapp, and API deployments.

Planned subfolders:
- `marketing/`: Landing visuals and copy assets.
- `store/`: App store uploads and screenshots.
- `app/`: App-bundled media previously in `attached_assets/`.
- `qa/`: QA fixtures (e.g., `public/qa-assets`).
- `backups/`: Archived artifacts (e.g., `zi4Koatz`, `ziCITmPe`).
